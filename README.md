# Learning-OOPS
This repo contains OOPS learning in python.


class and object with examples
class has data/attribute and function/methods:
   > code walkthrough
   > attributes get called itself whereas u cannot call methods/function manually 

why python is called oop? --> everything in python is object (
     data structures, data types etc )


Advantages of OOPS ?
1. code reusability
2. can create own/custom datatypes
3.debugging
4. easy to colloborate

Build project (chatbook class)
-> function vs method 
-> encapsulation
-> getter and setter
->static method
